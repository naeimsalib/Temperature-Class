# Temperature-Class
<br>
Created a Java Program to Help a Wheather channel Collect the Temprature in Fahreinhight and Convert it to Celsius and Kelvin<Br>
I First Created Two Files, One is a Class called Temperature in the Temperature.Java file <br>
and another file is temperatureRunner<br>
The Temperature Class takes in a auser Input , and that input represents the Weather in Fahrenheit <br>
It converts That Temperature From fahrenheit to celsius and Kelvin <br>
then Displays it to the User To be able to use it in there Weather channel Blog or anywhere else<Br>
